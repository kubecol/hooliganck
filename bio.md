# My Life
---

I was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I spent most of my summers going camping at Timber Trail in northern Wisconsin.
When I was in highschool I decided to join the United States Marine Corps. I served five years as a Comm/Nav technician working
on F18 for VMFA-251. After 5 years I decided to get out and get a civilan contractor job on MCAS IWAKUNI. Now I am going to school
and working on a degree in accounting with a minor in finance. 










### My Hobbies
---
I really enjoy watching sports. I find my self to be a die hard packers, brewers, badgers, and bucks fan. I would say my favorite 
sport to watch is football, but I love going to Brewers games the most. I also enjoy finances and reading amount stock markets. I'm currently reading a book about the 2008 finicial crises that occured.
